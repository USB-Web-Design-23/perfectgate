<th>Encompassing 12 acres within Washington Park, Portland's Japanese Garden is located on the grounds of an old zoo. It was first opened to the public in 1961 and built to give the citizens of Portland a place to find serenity in their day and to recognize the growing cultural ties between Oregon and Japan. Both impressions remain today at the Japanese Garden, and the area is beautifully laid out in a variety of styles that offer a uniquely peaceful experience for visitors.

<th>I’ve lost count of how many different clam chowders I’ve eaten in Oregon, but Ox’s is in a class all by itself. The name pretty much says it all: “Fresh Clam Chowder With Smoked Bone Marrow.” The flavorful, creamy broth is loaded with fresh in-shell clams and enhanced with smoked bone marrow and jalapeños. And to think we almost didn’t order it!

Specializing in open-fire Argentine-style cooking, Ox has an amazing menu with so many incredible choices. But don’t skip the chowder. Luckily we dined with my best friend from cooking school who lives in Portland. She set us right.
